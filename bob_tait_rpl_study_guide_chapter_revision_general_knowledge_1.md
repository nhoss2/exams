The onset of detonation in an engine is indicated by

* vibration, rising temperatures and reduced indicated air speed

* vibration, falling temperatures and reduced indicated air speed

* vibration, rising temperatures and increased indicated air speed

* vibration, falling temperatures and increased indicated air speed

----

Applying carburettor heat when ice is present in the carburettor is accompanied by

* a drop in engine RPM with no further change

* a drop in engine RPM followed by a rise

* an immediate rise in engine RPM

* an initial rise in engine RPM followed by a drop

----

The application of carburettor heat when no ice is present in the carburettor is accompanied by

* a drop in engine RPM with no further change

* a drop in engine RPM followed by a rise

* an immediate rise in engine RPM

* an initial rise in engine RPM followed by a drop

----

The reason for filling the tanks of an aircraft which is left parked over night in cold weather is

* to prevent water from collecting in the tank due to condensation

* to increase the weight of the aircraft in case of strong wind gusts

* to ensure you don't get caught if the price of fuel goes up overnight

* to prevent contamination from entering the tank through the vent

----

The pressure exerted on the piston during the power stroke increases as the amount of gas induced

* increases and combustion temperature increases

* decreases and combustion temperature increases

* increases and combustion temperature decreases

* decreases and combustion temperature decreases

----

As the throttle is moved towards the fully open position

* manifold pressure increases and gas flow decreases

* manifold pressure decreases and gas flow increases

* manifold pressure increases and gas flow increases

* manifold pressure decreases and gas flow decreases

----

The best action to take at the onset of detonation in an engine is

* lean the mixture and reduce the power

* lean the mixture and increase the power

* decrease the indicated air speed and maintain the power

* select mixture fully rich and decrease the power

----

The colour of 100 octane low lead [100 LL] aviation fuel is

* green

* red

* blue

* clear

----

Which of the following is the correct sequence for the four strokes of a four-stroke internal combustion engine?

* induction, compression, exhaust and power

* induction, power, compression and exhaust

* induction, exhaust, compression and power

* induction, compression, power and exhaust

----

If AVTUR was misidentified as AVGAS and added to the tanks of a piston engine aircraft, which of the following would be the most likely result?

* engine damage due to the extra power generated at take-off

* reduced power output and low engine temperature

* increased power output and high engine temperature

* reduced power output due to severe detonation

----

If a blockage in a fuel tank vent in a gravity fed system is not discovered and removed before flight

* there will be no effect providing the aircraft remains at low level

* the engine will not start

* fuel is likely to be lost overboard during flight

* the engine may fail completely due to fuel starvation

----

The octane rating of a fuel is a measure of

* its specific gravity

* its resistance to detonation

* its resistance to vaporisation

* its anti-misting properties in the event of fire
