What are the two fundamental types of airspace?

Controlled and non-controlled airspace.

----

Information to flights in Class G airspace is provided by (air traffic control/FLIGHTWATCH).

FLIGHTWATCH

----

What are the two divisions of controlled airspace?

Control areas and control zones.

----

What are the types of control zones?

Civil (Class C and D), and military.

----

The abbreviation CTR stands for (control zone/control area/controlled terminal radar).

Control zone.

----

At aerodromes in Class G airspace, traffic advisory frequencies have been established. What are these?

Common traffic advisory frequencies or CTAF.

----

The abbreviation FIA stands for (flight information aerodrome/flight information area).

Flight information area (FIA).

----

When inbound to a non-towered aerodrome, pilots should make a broadcast on the CTAF by what distance?

10 nm or broadcast area boundary whichever is greater.

----

Outside tower hours of operation, may controlled aerodromes revert to non-towered aerodromes with mandatory carriage and use of radio?

Yes, CERT, REG or MIL aerodromes on CTAF.

----

Where a discrete CTAF frequency is not listed for a non-towered aerodrome, broadcasts should be made on what frequency?

126.7MHz

----

Carriage of radio (is/is not) mandatory at a CERT aerodrome.

Is.

----

What are the broadcasts you must make at a CERT or REG non-towered aerodrome?

Taxiing, entering runway, clear of runway, when entering the vicinity of the aerodrome, intending to make a straight-in approach, joining Base.

----

At a CTAF (UNCR), the carriage of radio (is/is not) mandatory.

Not mandatory for UNCR aerodromes, but radio-equipped aircraft should still make broadcasts (taxiing, entering the runway, inbound and joining the circuit).

----

When a Class D control zone is deactivated after tower hours of operation, the zone can/cannot become a CTAF with mandatory radio.

Can.

----

At a REG aerodrome, the clearance to taxi (is/is not) required.

Is not.

----

Before taking off from a registered aerodrome with a CTAF, is an airways clearance required?

Not if going into Class G.

----

When operating in Class G airspace, not near a CTAF, you should listen out on appropriate (ATC centre frequency/FIA frequency/UNICOM frequency).

FIA frequency.

----

What are the two types of air traffic clearances which can be issued for operating in controlled airspace?

Clearances (to taxi, cross a runway, takeoff and land) and airways clearances (to operate in controlled airspace).

----

List the classes of airspace and explain what each means.

Class A - high altitude. Class C - controlled airspace, below FL600, including Class C CTRs. Class D - non-radar aerodrome CTRs (below 4,500 feet). Class E - controlled airspace with radar coverage between 8,500ft and FL125. Class G - all non-controlled airspace.

----

What facilities are provided to you in a flight information area (FIA)?

Flight information and SAR alerting services.
