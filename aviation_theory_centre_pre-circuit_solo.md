# Aviation Theory Centre Pre-Circuit Solo

Seat belts/safety harnesses must be worn, at all stages of flight, by:

* the pilot when he/she is the sole pilot.

* the occupants of both control seats.

* all on board during climb and descent.

* two children when they occupy a single seat.

----

Civil Aviation Regulations require that turns onto final approach must:

* commence not below 500ft AGL.

* be completed not closer than 500 metres from the threshold.

* be completed not closer than 500 metres from the aerodrome perimeter.

* be completed not closer than 500 metres away from any displaced threshold.

----

A pilot in command shall not consume any alcoholic liquor:

* 12 hours before the departure of the flight.

* 24 hours before reporting for duty.

* 8 hours before reporting for duty.

* 8 hours before the departure of the flight.

----

The minimum horizontal distance from cloud for a fixed-wing aircraft, operating in Class G airspace, is:

* 1,500 metres.

* 1,500ft.

* 1,000ft.

* clear of cloud.

----

The fuel system in an aircraft must be checked for water contamination:

* before each flight.

* before the first flight of the day and after each refuelling.

* before the first flight of the day and after the last flight of the day.

* at least once a day.

----

One restriction placed on VFR aircraft, operating at or below 2,000ft, is:

* minimum horizontal distance from cloud is 2,000 metres.

* minimum flight visibility is 6 km.

* navigation must be by visual reference to the ground or water.

* minimum vertical distance from cloud is 1,000ft.

----

A student pilot is not permitted to carry passengers unless:

* he/she has completed 2 hours as pilot in command.

* he/she has passed the General Flying Progress Test and flies within the student pilot area limits.

* he/she has completed 5 hours of cross-country flying.

* he/she has had a dual flight within the last 30 days.

----

With local QNH set on a subscale, an altimeter will always read:

* pressure height.

* density height.

* height above mean sea level.

* height above ground level.

----

At a non-towered aerodrome, you should not continue an approach beyond the threshold until a preceding light aeroplane, using the same runway has:

* landed, and has vacated the runway, irrespective of the runway length, and is taxiing away.

* landed, and is at least 1,800 metres from the landing threshold.

* taken off and is at least 200 AGL.

* taken off and is at least 600 metres ahead of the landing threshold.

----

You are to operate from a non-towered aerodrome where there is no ATIS and no other way of knowing the latest QNH. Before take-off, you should:

* set the altimeter to read the aerodrome elevation.

* set the altimeter to read zero feet.

* set an approximate aerodrome pressure in the subscale.

* set 1013hPa on the subscale.

----

One item which must be included in a passenger briefing prior to take-off is:

* a demonstration of the correct crash landing position.

* the use and location of fire extuingishers.

* the use and adjustment of seat belts.

* the demonstration of evacuation procedures.

----

With regard to the rules of the air in CAR, which statement is correct?

* An aircraft that is overtaking another aeroplane, has right of way.

* If an aeroplane and a glider are approaching head-on at approximately the same height the aeroplane must give way to the glider.

* An aircraft that is within 70 degrees of the astern position of an aircraft ahead is considered an overtaking aircraft, if its speed is greater.

* An aircraft that is overtaking another aircraft must do so by altering its heading to the left.

----

On which of the following types of flying is a passenger not permitted to be carried?

* An aircraft engaged in aerobatic flying.

* Flying training given to a person who has not passed the General Flying Progress Test (GFPT).

* An aircraft carrying out formation flying.

* An aircraft engaged in search and rescue (SAR) operations.

----

You are to carry out a flight from Parafield (GAAP) to the training area in a Piper Arrow -- XYG. You are also in receipt of ATIS information "Charlie", indicating Runway 21 Right is being used. Your pre-taxi radiocall will be:

* Parafield Ground, X-ray Yankee Golf, Piper Arrow, received Charlie, VFR for the Training Area, Runway 21 Right.

* Parafield Ground, Piper Arrow X-ray Yankee Golf, for the Training Area, Runway 21 Right, taxi clearance, received Charlie.

* Parafield Ground, X-ray Yankee Golf, for the Training Area, received Charlie.

* Parafield Ground, Piper Arrow X-ray Yankee Golf, taxi clearance for the Training Area, Runway 21 Right, received Charlie.

----

Area QNH is:

* the aerodrome pressure set in the altimeter before taxiing.

* the mean sea level pressure set in the altimeter before taxiing.

* the local aerodrome pressure set in the altimeter while on a navigation or cross-country flight.

* the mean sea level pressure set in the altimeter of the area over which the aircraft is flying while on a navigation or cross-country exercise.

----

When the aerodrome QNH is set, during taxi, the altimeter should read:

* zero.

* airfield elevation.

* vertical distance AGL.

* vertical distance AAL.

----

One of the basic rules following an engine failure immediately after take-off is:

* always try to restart the engine.

* immediately make a distress call.

* never turn back to the runway.

----

A hard pull up on the control column can cause an aeroplane to stall at almost any speed because:

* of reduced control effectiveness.

* the critical angle of attack can be exceeded.

* of decreased angle of attack.

* of reduced airspeed.

----

A white dumb-bell symbol has been placed adjacent the primary wind indicator on your airfield. This means:

* the airfield is completely unserviceable.

* poor surface this area, do not taxi here.

* parachute operations in progress.

* use hard surfaces only.

----

An aircraft stall-warning device will:

* indicate that a stall has occurred.

* cause a light to come on and a horn to sound after the aircraft stalls.

* indicate that the aircraft is approaching the stall at any attitude.
