Which of the following is true of VHF radio transmissions?

* more than one transmission can be received at the same time without interference

* distant stations can be received even when the aircraft is on the ground

* the signals travel by 'line of sight' and are shielded by the curvature of the earth

----

Which of the following is a VHF frequency?

* 124.7 MHz

* 6166 MHz

----

You hear the first part of a radio message clearly then a loud squeal drowns out the remainder. The most likely cause would be

* your squelch control is not properly set

* another station has transmitted on your frequency

* your receiver is set to the incorrect frequency

----

The number 7500 would be transmitted as

The best way for a pilot to assess the aircraft's attitude in space is to

* look at the wing tips in relation to the natural horizon

* look straight ahead to relate the nose of the aircraft to the natural horizon

----

A pilot knows that the aircraft is correctly trimmed when

* it is not losing or gaining any height

* the wings are level and the 'skid ball' is centred

* the trim position indicator indicates zero

* the required nose attitude is maintained even after the controls are released

----

As airspeed decreases [eg during the float before touch-down],

* forward visibility improves

* a larger degree of control deflection is required to maintain a given attitude

----

If an aircraft which is about to stall suffers a wing drop, the pilot should

* lower the nose, keep straight with aileron and use no rudder until the speed increases

* raise the nose and apply opposite aileron

* raise the nose, keep straight with rudder and use no aileron until the speed increases

----

During take-off in conditions of no wind, it is normally necessary to apply right rudder to maintain a straight take-off path. This is necessary because of

* the propeller slipstream pushing on the left side of the rudder

* engine torque pushing the left wheel harder onto the runway surface

* the lower airspeed over the ailerons during the take-off run

* Both the propeller slipstream pushing on the left side of the rudder and engine torque pushing the left wheel harder onto the runway surface

----

Compared to a normal approach, during a flapless approach at a given IAS the pilot will notice

* a higher nose attitude and a flatter approach path

* a lower nose attitude and a flatter approach path

* a higher nose attitude and a steeper approach path

* a lower attitude and a steeper approach path

----

During an approach on a windy day the pilot notices that the windsock is indicating frequent changes in surface wind speed and direction. In these conditions the pilot should

* approach at a lower IAS and higher nose attitude than normal

* be prepared to add power to restore IAS if wind shear is encountered

* be prepared to lower the nose to restore IAS if wind shear is encountered

* be prepared to add power and lower the nose to restore IAS if wind shear is encountered

----

During a glide approach in no wind at the recommended gliding IAS, raising the nose slightly will result in a slower approach speed but a flatter approach angle

* the statement is true

* the statement is false

----

The indication on the balance indicator *with ball to the left of centre* would require the pilot to

* apply more right aileron

* apply more right rudder

* apply more left aileron

* apply more left rudder

----

If the aerodrome ground marker *with two adjacent unfilled plus signs* is displayed near the wind sock of an uncontrolled aerodrome it indicates that

* gliding operations are in progress

* the aerodrome is closed to all operations

* all unsealed areas are unserviceable

* the aerodrome is suitable for light aircraft only
