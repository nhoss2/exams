What is the unit of frequency called, and what is its abbreviation?

Hertz, Hz

----

A frequency of 1,000 hertz can also be described as one (kilohertz/megahertz/microhertz).

Kilohertz.

----

Sketch a typical wave and label it with wavelength and amplitude.

Refer to figure A2-1.

----

In your own words, define wavelength and amplitude.

Wavelength is the length of one cycle of the wave; amplitude is the maximum extent of an oscillation as measured from the position of equilibrium.

----

Radio waves travel at the speed of (light/sound).

Light.

----

Light waves travel (slower than/the same speed as/faster than) sound waves.

Faster than.

----

What is the preferred frequency band for aeronautical radio communication?

VHF.

----

The range of VHF transmissions (increases/decreases) with gain of height.

Increases.

----

What control is used on VHF-COM radio sets to minimise unwanted background noise?

Squelch.

----

When transmitting on a particular frequency, can other people in the vicinity be transmitting on that frequency simultaneously?

No.

----

If the transmit button becomes stuck in the transmit position or is not released after a transmission, will other transmissions be affected? Will it block that frequency?

Yes. Yes.

----

The VOR radio navaid operates in a range of frequencies within the (VHF/MF/UHF) band.

VHF.

----

In which frequency bands do the NDB radio beacons operate?

LF and MF.

----

What equipment enables an air traffic radar controller to identify your aircraft by receiving coded signals?

Transponder.

----

For long-range voice communications, some aircraft are fitted with (UHF/MF/HF) radio equipment.

HF.
