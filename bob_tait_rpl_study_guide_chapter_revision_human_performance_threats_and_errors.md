# Bob Tait RPL Study Guide Chapter Revision Human Performance Threats and Errors

Select the item which best describes an external threat

* a noisy intoxicated passenger

* a pilot suffering from the effects of a hangover

* another aircraft entering the runway while you are on late final

* difficulty in understanding the transmission of a foreign pilot

----

Select the item which best describes an indesired aircraft state

* arrival over the threshold too high and too fast on a landing approach

* failing to notice a damaged tyre during a daily inspection

* failure to realise that a destination aerodrome requires an alternate

* aircraft overdue for its annual inspection

----

An example of an expected threat is

* thunderstorms forecast on the TAF

* engine failure in flight

* becoming lost in flight

* being diverted in flight by ATC

----

For the flight crew, the three basic components in the TEM model are

* threats, errors and undesired aircraft states

* threats, errors and anticipated aircraft states

* threats, flight crew human resources and aircraft states

* errors, flight crew human resources and undesired aircraft states

----

Which of the following would be classified as an external threat

* pressure to meet timetables

* pilot fatigue

* health and fitness

* lack of familiarity with other crew members

----

An example of a latent threat is

* undercarriage will not retract in flight

* wind gusts exceeding the aircraft's cross wind limitations for landing

* poor aircraft equipment design

* unexpected high traffic volume in the terminal area

----

Entering the incorrect way-point data while operating in a stressful cockpit environment is an example of

* an environmental threat leading to a configuration error

* an organisational threat leading to a committed error

* an expected threat leading to an unexpected error

* an unexpected threat leading to an expected error

----

The three primary categories of error in the TEM model are

* loss of heading control, loss of attitude control and loss of airspeed control

* navigational error, radio frequency error and navigation aid error

* crew resource error, airtrafffic control error and ground handling error

* aircraft handling errors, procedural errors and communication errors

----

Undesired aircraft states are categorised by the TEM model as

* aircraft handling, ground handling and incorrect aircraft configuration

* aircraft ground handling, vertical navigation and incorrect inflight configuration

* vertical navigation, ground handling and inflight navigation

* aircraft configuration, ground handling and inflight aircraft handling

----

Track and speed deviation are examples of

* ground navigation state

* aircraft handling state

* horizontal navigation state

* aircraft configuration state

----

Unauthorised penetration of controlled airspace is an example of an undesired

* ground navigation state

* aircraft handling state

* air navigation state

* navigation configuration state

----

Being positioned at the incorrect holding point prior to take-off is an example of an undesired

* aircraft handling state

* aircraft ground configuration state

* situational awareness state

* ground navigation state

----

Incorrect navigation aid setting is an example of

* ground navigation state

* aircraft navigation state

* horizontal navigation state

* situational awareness state

----

With regard to TEM, the use of a checklist prior to take-off is an example of

* a desirable aircraft state

* a safety state

* a countermeasure

* a safety tactic

----

When considering the risk any threat imposes you should consider

* the probability of encountering the threat irrespective of the consequences

* the seriousness of the consequences irrespective of the probability of encountering the threat

* the probability of encountering the threat and the seriousness of the consequences

* the probability of encountering the threat at any stage during the flight

----

When an undesired aircraft state is identified the primary task should be

* identify the error which led to the undesired aircraft state

* identify and correct the error which led to the undesired aircraft state

* deal with the undesired aircraft state and return to controlled stabilised flight

* advise ATC of the undesired aircraft state

----

One measure of the effectiveness of actions taken by a crew to manage threats is

* the accuracy of the crew's recall of events during de-briefing

* the speed with which the crew acted to manage the threat

* whether the threat was detected in time for the crew to respond appropriately

* whether an undesired aircraft state was avoided

----

The most proactive option in thread management is to

* anticipate the recovery action required if the threat occurs

* anticipate and avoid the threat altogether

* take corrective action once the threat has occurred

* concentrate on management of any undesired aircraft state that may result

----

Mismanaged threats usually lead to

* errors which are then linked to undesired aircraft states

* undesired aircraft states which are then linked to errors

* aircraft handling errors which then lead to environmental errors

* diversion from standard operating procedures

----

With regard to TEM, a cockpit systems failure warning light is an example of

* a proactive decision making process

* a systemic-based countermeasure

* an undesired aircraft state management device

* a handling error countermeasure
