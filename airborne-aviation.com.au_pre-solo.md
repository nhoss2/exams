* raise the stall speed

----

You are in the circuit flying the base leg. You find yourself too close to an aircraft also on the base leg. The best course of action is to:

You are listening to a radio transmission and hear the first part clearly, while the second part is a loud squealing noise. The most likely cause is:

* two stations transmitting at the same time

* a problem with your squelch adjustment

* normal interference as a result of solar radiation flares

* the electrical system in the aircraft is failing

----

If your engine fails shortly after take-off while on the upwind leg you should:

* execute an immediate turn back towards the runway you departed from

* lower the nose to maintain a safe airspeed and choose a landing site that requires minimal turning

* raise the nose to extend your glide performance and select a field within range

* transmit a MAYDAY call immediately with details of your situation then decide upon a plan of action

----

The runway is occupied and you are required to go-around. The most correct sequence of actions is:

* Raise the nose to a climbing attitude, apply full power, retract the flaps

* Retract the flaps, raising the nose with power application

* Raise the nose to a climbing attitude, retract the flaps to reduce drag, apply full power

* Apply full power while raising the nose to a climbing attitude, raising the flap slowly when climbing

----

Compared to an approach at full flap, an approach with no flaps at the same IAS will require:

----

You are lining up behind another aircraft that has just landed on the runway you are planning to take-off from. You must not commence your take-off roll until the landing aircraft has:

* started to turn towards the runway exit

* The coriolis effect

* Both slipstream and torque as listed above

----

When setting QNH on the altimeter while parked on an aerodrome the altimeter will read:

----

You are heading for a night out at the pub on Friday. You have a flying lesson booked for 7am Saturday morning, when must you stop drinking alcohol?
