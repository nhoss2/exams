Which of the following is a limitation of the directional gyro?

* the directional gyro is more difficult to read accurately

* the directional gyro wobbles about in turbulent conditions

* the directional gyro does not automatically line up with north, it must be set by reference to a compass

* the directional gyro reads incorrectly during turns

----

When setting a directional gyro, care should be taken to ensure that

* the aircraft is facing north

* the aircraft is not losing or gaining any height

* the aircraft's electrical system is turned off

* the aircraft is in steady wings-level flight in smooth air

----

Which of the following instruments rely on the static vent to give a reliable reading?

* Airspeed Indicator, Altimeter and Vertical Speed Indicator

* Airspeed Indicator, Artificial Horizon and Vertical Speed Indicator

* Turn and Balance Indicator, Artificial Horizon and Altimeter

* Vertical Speed Indicator, Turn and Balance Indicator and Airspeed Indicator

----

What is the significant of the white arc on the face of the airspeed indicator?

* it indicates the fastest and slowest speeds at which it is safe to fly

* it indicates the safe climbing speeds for use after take-off

* it indicates the range of approach speeds that may be used for landing

* it indicates the safe speeds at which the aeroplane may be operated with flap extended

----

VNE is the maximum indicated airspeed at which

* the flaps may be lowered

* a turn may be commenced

* the aircraft may operate under any circumstances

* the aircraft may operate in turbulence

----

The function of a battery is to

* store electrical energy for the system to use when the alternator is not operating

* supply the current to allow the spark plugs to generate a spark

* supply all the electrical demands of the system during flight

* to keep the alternator fully charged

----

The function of an alternator is to

* supply all the electrical demands of the system during flight

* supply current to the spark plugs during start-up

* to act as a back-up in case the battery fails

* to store electrical energy when the engine is not running

----

The normal reading on a centre zero ammeter during flight should be

* zero

* a charge indication which depends on the number of electrical loads turned on

* a constant small charge

* a discharge depending on the number of electrical loads turned on

----

Continued cranking of an engine which is difficult to start could result in

* damage to engine components due to low oil pressure during start-up

* a fire risk due to surplus fuel vapour flowing through the engine

* stone damage to the propellor

* overheating and damage to the battery and/or starter motor

----

Which of the following describes the difference between a circuit breaker and a fuse?

* a circuit breaker interrupts the current while a fuse does not

* a circuit breaker is not suitable for use when the current flow is high, while a fuse is

* a circuit breaker does not interrupt the current flow while a fuse does

* a circuit breaker may be reset after it has been 'tripped' but a fuse cannot
