# Bob Tait RPL Study Guide Chapter Revision Human Performance 2

The period of validity of a medical certificate for a pilot over forty years of age, unless otherwise cancelled or suspended is

* 2 years for student and private pilot licences and 1 year for commercial licences

* 2 years for student and 1 year for private pilot licences and commercial licences

* 1 year for student and 2 years for private pilot licences and commercial licences

* 2 years for all classes of licence

----

Hyperventilation is likely to result in

* a change in the acidity of the blood caused by a drop in carbon dioxide levels

* severe headaches and vomiting

* sinus pain and discomfort in the middle ear

* lightheadedness associated with an increase in carbon dioxide levels

----

Abdominal pain caused by the expansion of gases within the body is most likely to be associated with

* a rapid climb in a high performance unpressurised aircraft

* a rapid descent in a high performance unpressurised aircraft

* a rapid climb in a high performance pressurised aircraft

* a rapid descent in a high performance pressurised aircraft

----

At an altitude of 18000ft the ambient atmospheric pressure is approximately

* one third of its sea-level value

* one half of its sea-level value

* two thirds of its sea-level value

* one tenth of its sea-level value

----

At a depth of about 30 feet, the underwater pressure is closest to

* one and a half times normal sea-level atmospheric pressure

* two times normal sea-level atmospheric pressure

* three times normal sea-level atmospheric pressure

* one half of normal sea-level atmospheric pressure

----

Decompression sickness or the 'bends' is caused by

* difficulty experienced in breathing under the high ambient pressure which occurs in deep water

* the excess oxygen which dissolves in the blood during a deep dive

* the release of dissolved nitrogen from the blood during a rapid ascent from deep water

* cramps caused by the low ambient temperature which occurs in deep water

----

A SCUBA diver has just completed a dive which did require decompression stops but was of less than four hours duration. The minimum recommended period which should be allowed before flying is

* 4 hours

* 12 hours

* 24 hours

* 48 hours

----

Which of the following would be an appropriate way to combat the effects of hyperventilation?

* breathe more rapidly

* make a conscious effort to slow down the breathing rate

* take a deep breath and hold it

* breathe more deeply

----

Hyperventilation is caused by

* too much carbon monoxide in the air

* too much carbon dioxide in the air

* breathing too fast and/or too deep for the body's requirements

* holding the breath too long

----

Alcohol can still be detected in the blood for

* 14 hours after ingestion

* 14 hours after the blood alcohol level has reached .05

* 24 hours after ingestion

* 24 hours after the blood alcohol level has reached .05

----

Which of the following would be an appropriate remedy for a person who is suffering the effects of hyperventilation?

* hold the breath for about 40 seconds

* breathe into a paper bag

* increase the rate and depth of breathing

* use a nasal decongestant

----

If it becomes necessary to take sleeping tablets, how much time should be allowed before flying?

* 12 hours

* 24 hours

* none if they provided a good night's sleep

* 8 hours

----

If a pilot completed a SCUBA dive which required decompression stops during ascent and was more than 4 hours duration, which of the following would apply?

* a rest at sea-level of at least 24 hours is requred before flying

* a rest at sea-level of at least 48 hours is requred before flying

* a rest at sea-level of at least 12 hours is requred before flying

* a rest at sea-level of at least 6 hours is requred before flying
