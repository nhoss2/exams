A wind in a terminal area forecast expressed as VRB30G45 would:

* Always be associated with closely spaced isobars around a trough

* Be improbable, since variable wind directions are only associated with light winds and high pressure systems

* Probably be associated with a thunderstorm

* Always be associated with closely spaced isobars around a ridge

----

The validity of a METAR is:

* 3 hours

* 6 hours

* 30 hours

* Not applicable

----

The wind direction is given in degrees:

* Magnetic in both area and aerodrome forecasts

* Magnetic in an area forecast, and true in an aerodrome forecast

* True in both area and aerodrome forecasts

* True in an area forecast, and magnetic in an aerodrome forecast

----

In a METAR for YAAA, the figures quoted immediately before the QNH read 9/8, and at YBBB they read 10/8. This means that, at place YAAA, the dry bulb is 9C and the:

* Dew point is 8C and fog is closer to forming at YAAA than YBBB

* Wet bulb is 8C and fog is closer to forming at YAAA than YBBB

* Dew point is 8C and fog is closer to forming at YBBB than YAAA

* Wet bulb is 8C and fog is closer to forming at YBBB than YAAA

A TAF includes the following:    > INTER 0710/0714 2000 -SHSN    This forecasts, between the times indicated:

* Showers and snow of expected duration 30 to 60 minutes

* Showers of snow of expected duration 30 to 60 minutes

* Showers and snow of expected duration less than 30 minutes

* Showers of snow of expected duration less than 30 minutes

----

The validity period of an aerodrome forecast is from 0000Z on the 1st to 0600Z on the 2nd. In the forecast this is written:

* 0100/0206

* 010006

* 0100/06

* 01000206

----

In a TAF, the term FU VV030 means:

* Smoke and a visibility of 3,000 metres

* Smoke and a vertical visibility of 3,000 feet

* Fumes and a visibility of 3.000 metres

* Fumes and a vertical visibility of 3,000 feet

----

Observed intermediate QNH values are rounded:

* Down so that the altimeter reading is from a pressure level slightly lower than MSL

* Down so that the altimeter reading is from a pressure level slightly higher than MSL

* Up so that the altimeter reading is from a pressure level slightly lower than MSL

* Up so that the altimeter reading is from a pressure level slightly higher than MSL

----

When cruising below the transition layer (10,000') you can set a local QNH of a station along the route provided it is within:

* 10NM of the aircraft

* 50NM of the aircraft

* 100NM of the aircraft

* 200NM of the aircraft

----

A TAF commences and finishes as follows:      > TAF YCOM 070635Z 0708/0720 ... Q 1020 1021 1019 1018      The forecast QNH for time 071320 is:

* 1020

* 1021

* 1019

* 1018
