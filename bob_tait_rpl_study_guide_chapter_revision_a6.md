# Bob Tait RPL Study Guide Chapter Revision A6

An aerofoil is said to be at its stalling angle if any increase or decrease in angle of attack

* produces less lift and less drag

* produces a lower lift/drag ratio

* produces less lift

* produces more drag

----

If angle of attack is increased from zero to beyond the stalling angle at constant indicated air speed, the magnitude of the force of drag

* increases then decreases

* decreases continuously

* decreases then increases

* increases continuously

----

Any increase in the angle of attack of an aerofoil up to the stalling angle, at constant indicated air speed causes

* lift to increase and drag to increase

* lift to increase and drag to decrease

* lift to decrease and drag to increase

* lift to decrease and drag to decrease

----

A pilot must maintain a back pressure on the control column during a level balanced turn. This is necessary to

* increase the angle of attack

* create extra drag to slow the aircraft down during the turn

* allow the elevators to help turn the aircraft in the desired direction

* improve the visibility in the direction of the turn

----

If an aircraft is slipping during a level turn, a remedy would be

* apply more rudder in the direction of turn

* apply less rudder in the direction of turn

* apply more bank in the direction of turn

* apply greater back pressure on control column

----

Which of the following would be the best definition of the stalling speed?

* the speed which requires the lowest angle of attack in level flight

* the speed which requires the stalling angle to produce the necessary lift

* the speed at which the aircraft should become airborne during take-off

* the speed which produces the best angle of climb after take-off

----

Which of the following would decrease the IAS at which the stall occurred?

* an increase in angle of bank during a turn

* an increase in flap extension during level flight

* a decrease in engine power

* a strong headwind

----

If the aircraft suffers a wing-drop at the point of stall due to turbulent conditions, the correct control input to safely recover would be to

* maintain strong back pressure and apply full opposite aileron

* maintain strong back pressure and apply opposite rudder

* relax the back pressure and apply full opposite aileron

* relax the back pressure and apply opposite rudder

----

You are about to take off from a runway immediately after a heavy jet has taken off from the same runway. Which of the following actions would give the best change of avoiding its wake turbulence?

* taking off beyond its lift-point, using a shallower angle of climb and maintaining runway heading

* taking off before its lift-off point, using a steeper angle of climb and turning to remain down wind of its flight path

* taking off before its lift-off point, using a steeper angle of climb and maintaining runway heading

* taking off before its lift-off point, using a steeper angle of climb and turning to remain up wind of its flight path

----

Compared to nil wind conditions, which of the following effects will be noticed when climbing into a headwind?

* both the rate and angle of climb will increase

* angle of climb will increase and rate of climb will decrease

* both the rate and angle of climb will decrease

* angle of climb will increase and rate of climb will remain unaltered

----

Wingtip vortices in level flight will be strongest when

* weight is increased and speed is increased

* weight is increased and speed is decreased

* weight is decreased and speed is decreased

* weight is decreased and speed is increased

----

You are about to take off from a runway immediately after a heavy jet aircraft has taken off from the same runway. Which of the following is the most dangerous hazard that could affect your take-off?

* difficulty in directional control caused by the blast of the jet engine exhaust

* turbulence after lift-off caused by the wing-tip vortices of the larger aircraft

* difficulty in directional control during the take-off run caused by the wing-tip vortices of the jet

* reduction in engine power because of the heated air behind the departing jet

----

As the angle of bank in a level turn is increased, the load factor

* increases and the stalling speed decreases

* increases and the stalling speed increases

* decreases and the stalling speed decreases

* decreases and the stalling speed increases

----

During a 60deg bank level turn, the load factor will be

* the same as in level flight

* twice that in level flight

* 40% greater than in level flight

* 40% less than in level flight

----

During a 60deg level turn, the stalling speed will be

* the same as in level flight

* twice that in level flight

* 40% greater than in level flight

* 40% less than in level flight

----

When turning at low level on a very windy day a pilot may notice

* an illusion of slipping or skidding when turning cross wind

* an increased rate of turn when turning upwind

* difficulty balancing the turn

* a tendency to overbank

----

One result of the application of abrupt back pressure on the control column during a dive would be

* a decrease in the angle of attack and less lift

* a decrease in the angle of attack and more lift

* an increase in the angle of attack and possibly a stall

* an decrease in the angle of attack and possibly a stall

----

Wake turbulence would be most severe behind

* a heavy aircraft flying slowly

* a light aircraft flying slowly

* a heavy aircraft flying fast

* a light aircraft flying fast
