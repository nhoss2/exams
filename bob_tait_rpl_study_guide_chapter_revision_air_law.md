# Bob Tait RPL Study Guide Chapter Revision Air Law

When two powered aircraft are converging at the same level, the aircraft that should give way is

* the one which has the other on its right

* the one which has the other on its left

----

If the pilot of a powered aircraft sights a glider converging from his left at the same height

* the aircraft which has the other on its right should give way

* the pilot of the powered aircraft should give way

* the glider should give way

* both aircraft should turn to the right

----

A pilot must check that all flight controls are free to move in the correct sense and to the full extent of their travel

* only before the first flight of each day

* during the take-off roll

* immediately before take-off

* before the aircraft commences to taxi

----

During the take-off run it is necessary to check the operation of

* the primary flight controls

* the air speed indicator

* the radio

* the brakes

----

The fuel system must be inspected for the presence of water

* before taxiing for take-off

* before starting the engine

* before the first flight of each day and after each refuelling

* only after refuelling

----

Refuelling of aircraft must not commence unless the fuel tank filler cap or vents are at least metres away from

* any sealed building

* any other parked aircraft

* members of the public

* any unsealed building

----

An aircraft being refuelled must be parked

* as close as possible to the fire extinguisher

* so that it is facing into the wind

* with the park brake on and the wheels chocked

* so that it can be rapidly moved if it becomes necessary

----

An aircraft engine must not be started within 5 metres of

* any sealed building

* any exposed public area

* any unsealed building

* any other aircraft

----

Except for take-off, landing or by stress of weather, an aircraft must not fly over any town or populous area at a

* 1500 ft AGL

* 1500 ft AMSL

* 1000 ft AGL

* 1000 ft AMSL

----

Except by stress of weather or during take-off or landing, an aircraft must not fly over any area at a height lower than

* 1500 ft AGL

* 1500 ft AMSL

* 1000 ft AGL

* 1000 ft AMSL

----

For a flight in a training area over sea-level terrain and outside controlled airspace at 3500 ft, the required visibility and vertical separation from the cloud base is

* 8 km and 1000 ft

* 5 km and 500 ft

* 5 km and 1000 ft

* 5 km and clear of cloud

----

A recommended means for checking for the presence of water in aviation gasoline, is to drain a small sample of fuel from the fuel drain

* into a clean container and check for a cloudy colour

* into a clean container and check for the presence of globules of water in the bottom of the sample

* into a container which already contains a sample of pure fuel and check for a visible demarcation between the two fluids or for globules of water in the bottom of the sample

* remove the fuel filter and check for the presence of water

----

Fuel tank vents must be checked for freedom from obstruction

* before each flight

* before the first flight of each day

* before each take-off

* after each refuelling

----

Two aircraft are on converging courses and there is danger of collision. The ultimate responsibility to avoid collision is on:

* the pilot who has the other on his right

* the pilot who has the other on his left

* the pilot of the slower aircraft

* both pilots are responsible

----

Select the conditions which the pilot must maintain when a Special VFR [SVFR] clearance to enter a Class D CTR is issued.

* clear of cloud and 5000m visibility

* 1500m from cloud and 1600m visibility

* clear of cloud and 1600m visibility

* 1000ft vertically from cloud and 3000m visibility

----

During take-off from a licenced aerodrome your aircraft suffered a bird strike to the windscreen. The aircraft suffered no damage as a result of the collision. As a pilot in command you should

* report the incident immediately by phone and follow up with a written report within 72 hours

* not make an immediate report but make a written report within 72 hours

* report the incident immediately by phone and follow up with a written report within 48 hours

* make no report if no damage was done to the aircraft
