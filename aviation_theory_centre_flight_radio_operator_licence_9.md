List the frequency bands used in aviation and state what each band is used for.

Low frequency (LF) - non-directional beacons (NDB). Medium frequency (MF) - non-directional beacons (NDB). High frequency (HF) - long range voice communications. Very high frequency (VHF) - normal, everyday voice communications, VOR and ILS localiser directional signal (radio navigation aids). Ultra high frequency (UHF) - military voice communications, ILS glideslope, international DME, secondary surveillance radar (SSR). Very low frequency (VLF) - global navigation systems such as Omega.

----

The range over which VHF transmissions can be received is known as (visible/radio) horizon.

Radio horizon.

----

What is the expected range of VHF reception for an aeroplane flying at 7,000ft?

VHF range in nm = `sqrt (1.5 * 7,000) = sqrt 10,500 = 102nm`.

----

What are the approximate ranges of VHF transmissions for an aeroplane when it is at 1,000ft, 5,000ft and 10,000ft?

`1,000ft: 40nm`. `5,000ft: 90nm`. `10,000ft: 120nm`.

----

In which CASA publication would you find the expected VHF communication coverage at 5,000ft and 10,000ft?

Planning Chart Australia (PCA).

----

Draw a diagram showing reflecting and refraction of radio waves.

Refer to Figure A2-2.

----

When a radio wave is attenuated, the signal strength is progressively (increased/decreased).

Decreased.

----

Draw a diagram to show the difference between amplitude and frequency modulation.

Refer to Figure A2-3.

----

List five fundamental components of a radio transmitter, and briefly explain their function.

Each radio transmitter has: a power supply to provide direct current; an oscillator to generate a radio frequency (carrier wave) and a device for controlling the frequency of the generated signal; an amplifier to increase the output of the oscillator; a modulator to add the intelligence signals (e.g. from the microphone) to the carrier wave; and an antenna (or aerial) to transmit the signals out into space.

----

If two radio waves arrive simultaneously at a receiver, and are in phase, the resultant signal will be (stronger/weaker) than when they are received out of phase.

Stronger.

----

The layer in the atmoshpere which refracts radio waves back to the surface of the earth is called the (troposphere/ionosphere/mesosphere).

Ionosphere.

----

The radio waves that are refracted back to the earth's surface by a layer in the atmosphere are in the (VHF/HF/UHF) band.

HF.

----

When using HF for voice communications at night, the (lower/higher) the frequency, the greater the transmission range.

Lower.

----

As a general rule, when using HF communications, the closer you are to a station, the (lower/higher) frequency you should use.

Lower.

----

Draw a diagram and show skip distance varying with radio transmission frequency.

Refer to Figure A2-4.
