# Bob Tait RPL Study Guide Chapter Revision A3

Drag is that component of the total reaction which acts

* at right angles to the relative airflow

* opposite to the direction of motion and parallel to the relative airflow

* at right angles to the chord line

* in the same direction as motion and parallel to the relative airflow

----

The chief source of drag on an aircraft flying level at low airspeed is

* lift is no longer acting at right angles to the relative airflow

* air spilling over the wingtips producing vortices and eddies

* the angle of attack being lower than at normal cruising speed

* the elevator requiring a large degree of deflection

----

The form of drag which predominates at low airspeed is called

* parasite drag

* total drag

* airflow drag

* induced drag

----

The form of drag which predominates at high airspeed is called

* parasite drag

* total drag

* airflow drag

* induced drag

----

As airspeed is increased in level flight from just above stalling speed to maximum speed, the induced drag acting

* increases continuously

* decreases continuously

* increases then decreases

* decreases then increases

----

As airspeed is increased in level flight from just above stalling speed to maximum speed, the parasite drag acting

* increases continuously

* decreases continuously

* increases then decreases

* decreases then increases

----

The combined effect of induced drag and parasite drag gives rise to total drag. The *least* total drag occurs

* at low airspeed when parasite drag is lowest

* at high airspeed when parasite drag is lowest

* at an intermediate airspeed when both induced and parasite drag are fairly low

* at the stalling speed when the speed of the relative airflow is lowest

----

As speed is reduced in level flight from maximum speed to the stalling speed, the total drag acting

* increases continuously

* decreases continuously

* increases then decreases

* decreases then increases

----

A wing enjoys its maximum efficiency in level flight when

* airspeed is highest

* airspeed is lowest

* total drag is least

* lift is greatest

----

The best lift/drag ratio occurs

* at the stalling angle where maximum lift is being produced

* at the smallest possible angle of attack where minimum drag is being produced

* at a medium angle of attack where the required lift is accompanied by least drag

* at the lowest airspeed where the least disturbance to the airflow occurs
