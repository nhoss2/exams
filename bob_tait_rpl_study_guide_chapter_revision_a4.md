# Bob Tait RPL Study Guide Chapter Revision A4

The application of high power with low airspeed is accompanied by

* engine torque producing a roll

* a reduction in elevator effectiveness

* engine torque producing a yaw

* slipstream effect producing a roll

----

The effect of propellor slipstream on a single-engine aeroplane is to

* produce a yaw at low IAS and high power

* produce a roll at low IAS and high power

* produce a yaw at high IAS and low power

* product a nose-down pitch at low IAS and high power

----

The effect of a strong crosswind from the left while taxiing on level ground is

* the aircraft will tend to yaw to the left

* the aircraft will tend to yaw to the right

* the aircraft will tend to roll to the left

* the aircraft will tend to roll and yaw to the right

----

Consider an aircraft flying at 5,500ft in a headwind. Under these conditions

* IAS would be higher than TAS which would be higher than GS

* GS would be higher than TAS which would be higher than IAS

* IAS would be higher than TAS which would be lower than GS

* IAS would be lower than TAS which would be higher than GS

----

Which of the following would be most effective in reducing induced drag?

* fitting wheel fairings

* streamlining all surfaces exposed to the airflow

* fitting wing root fairings

* increasing the aspect ratio of the wing

----

If airspeed is kept constant, which of the following is an effect of extending flap during level flight?

* lift increases and drag decreases

* lift increases and drag increases

* lift decreases and drag decreases

* lift decreases and drag increases

----

Which of the following is an effect of lowering full flap during a glide?

* a steeper descent path may be flown at the same airspeed

* the extra lift will produce a flatter descent path

* the aircraft will be able to fly down the same descent path at a lower airspeed

* forward visibility will be reduced

----

Under what circumstances should flap be used for take-off?

* flap should never be used for take-off under any circumstances

* flap should be used only as specified by the manufacturer

* full flap should be used if the field is of marginal length

* flap should be used during the take-off roll if the pilot feels it is necessary

----

If airspeed is kept constant, which of the following is an effect of extending flap during level flight?

* a higher nose attitude is required to maintain lift

* it is possible to fly level with a lower nose attitude

* less power is required to maintain a given airspeed

* the elevator and rudder controls will become more effective

----

If all other factors remain the same, what effect will a decrease in air density have on the take off distance required?

* the distance required increases

* the distance required remains the same unless weight is increased

* the distance required decreases because of reduced drag

* the distance required remains the same providing full power is used

----

Which of the figures below correctly shows the relative positions of the tailplane, elevator and trim tab on an aircraft which has been trimmed for level flight at low airspeed?

* elevator deflecting upward from aerofoil, trim tab deflecting downward from elevator

* elevator deflecting downward from aerofoil, trim tab deflecting downward from elevator

* elevator deflecting downward from aerofoil, trim tab deflecting upward from elevator

* elevator deflecting upward from aerofoil, trim tab deflecting upward from elevator

----

Compared to nil wind conditions, a tailwind component during take-off will result in

* a decrease in the distance required for take-off

* an increase in the distance required for take-off

* a decrease in the IAS required for take-off

* an increase in the IAS required for take-off

----

Which of the following combination of factors would have the most detrimental effect on the take-off performance of an aeroplane?

* high temperature, high airfield elevation and a high pressure system

* high temperature, high airfield elevation and a low pressure system

* low temperature, low airfield elevation and a low pressure system

* high temperature, low airfield elevation and a low pressure system

----

If frost forms on the wings of an aircraft overnight and is not removed before flight

* the acceleration during the take-off run will be less than normal

* the stalling angle will be higher than normal

* the take-off distance could be greatly increased

* there will be an increase in stalling speed and stalling angle

----

The purpose of aerodynamic balancing of control surfaces is to

* lighten the in-flight loads on the control column

* prevent the control surface from fluttering

* to increase the rate at which the aircraft responds to control inputs

* ensure the aircraft will be controllable at low airspeed
