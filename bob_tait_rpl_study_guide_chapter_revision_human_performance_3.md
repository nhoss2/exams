Which of the following is a function of the middle ear?

* to protect the eardrum from the intrusion of foreign bodies

* to amplify the vibrations arriving at the eardrum and transfer them to the cochlea

* to convert the mechanical energy of vibrations to nerve impulses

* to assist in maintaining the sense of balance

----

Which of the following is a function of the inner ear?

* to protect the eardrum from the intrusion of foreign bodies

* to amplify the vibrations arriving at the eardrum and transfer them to the cochlea

* to convert the mechanical energy of vibrations to nerve impulses and assist in maintaining the sense of balance

* to equalise the pressure on either side of the eardrum

----

Which of the following mediates the sense of balance?

* the cochlea

* the semicircular canals

* the hammer, anvil and stirrup

* the eustachian tube

----

Deterioration of hearing caused by exposure to loud noise usually occurs first

* in the high frequency range, above normal speech

* in the frequency range of normal speech, 300 to 5000Hz

* in the frequency range below normal speech

* across the whole range of audible frequencies

----

Which of the following is the minimum noise level that would mark the onset of temporary or permanent deafness after prolonged exposure?

* 85dB

* 110dB

* 140dB

* 160dB

----

Which of the following is the function of the eustachian tube in the human respiratory system?

* it connects the middle ear to the outer ear

* it connects the middle ear to the inner ear

* it connects the middle ear to the throat cavity

* it connects the inner ear to the throat cavity

----

Hearing loss due to long-term exposure to high noise levels is usually first noticed in the loss of sensitivity to

* high frequency sounds

* low frequency sounds

* medium frequency sounds

* all frequencies of sound

----

Which part of the ear is most affected by pressure differences when the eustachian tube is blocked?

* the outer ear

* the middle ear

* the inner ear

* the ear lobe
