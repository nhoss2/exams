# Bob Tait RPL Study Guide Chapter Revision A1

Deflection of the elevators in flight cause the aeroplane to

* pitch about its normal axis

* pitch about its lateral axis

* yaw about its normal axis

* pitch about its longitudinal axis

----

Which of the following correctly associates the control surface, type of motion involved and the axis about which that motion occurs?

* rudder, yaw, longitudinal

* elevator, pitch, normal

* aileron, roll, longitudinal

* rudder, pitch, normal

----

The centre of gravity of an aircraft is a point

* halfway along the longitudinal axis

* in the centre of the wing

* at which all three axes intersect

* directly above the wheels

----

The best indication of nose attitude is obtained when the pilot

* looks to the side and notes the position of the wing tips in relation to the horizon

* looks to the front and notes the position of the horizon in the aircraft's windscreen

* looks at the instrument panel and notes the aircraft's present height and speed

* looks to the right and asks the instructor to point it out

----

When the control column is turned to the left during flight

* the right aileron is raised and the aircraft rolls to the right

* the left aileron is raised and the aircraft rolls to the left

* the right aileron is raised and the aircraft rolls to the left

* the left aileron is raised and the aircraft rolls to the right

----

When the right rudder pedal is depressed during flight

* the rudder moves to the left and the aircraft yaws to the left

* the rudder moves to the left and the aircraft yaws to the right

* the rudder moves to the right and the aircraft yaws to the left

* the rudder moves to the right and the aircraft yaws to the right

----

When a back pressure is applied to the control column during straight and level flight

* the elevator is deflected up and the aircraft adopts a higher nose attitude

* the elevator is deflected up and the aircraft adopts a lower nose attitude

* the elevator is deflected down and the aircraft adopts a lower nose attitude

* the elevator is deflected down and the aircraft adopts a higher nose attitude

----

If no control input is made by the pilot, which of the following types of aircraft motion will always occur simultaneously?

* pitch and yaw

* pitch and roll

* pitch, yaw and roll

* yaw and roll

----

Which is the most appropriate recovery action if an aircraft is allowed to enter a spiral dive?

* pull back firmly on the control column

* apply full rudder against the direction of turn

* apply opposite aileron to level the wings

* apply aileron in the direction of turn until the wings are level

----

A single-engine aircraft is climbing with high power applied and low airspeed. Which of the following will be true concerning the effectiveness of the flying controls?

* the ailerons and rudder will be more effective than the elevator

* the ailerons will be less effective than the elevator or rudder

* the ailerons will be more effective than the elevator or rudder

* the ailerons and elevator will be more effective than the rudder
