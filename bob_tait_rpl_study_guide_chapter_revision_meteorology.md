# Bob Tait RPL Study Guide Chapter Revision Meteorology

Which conditions are most likely to produce radiation fog?

* thin overcast with no wind

* broken cloud with no wind

* nil cloud and light wind

* scattered cumulus with light wind

----

During what stage of a thunderstorm would lightning be most frequent?

* before any precipitation

* during the most rapid growth

* at the mature stage

* during the dissipating stage

----

The lifting of fog may be caused by

* a fall of temperature

* the formation of upper cloud

* an increase in wind strength

* an increase in humidity

----

Which phenomena in a thunderstorm causes low level wind shear at some distance away from the cell?

* updraft

* downdraft

* hail

* turbulence

----

Where are tornadoes most likely to be encountered?

* over hot desert country

* with mountain waves

* strong low pressure systems

* wide spread severe thunderstorm activity

----

Which process is involved in the formation of hoar frost?

* accumulation of ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere

* liquid water freezing on impact with the aircraft surface

* deposition of ice directly from the water vapour mixed with the air

* freezing of large supercooled water droplets

----

The condition most likely to produce advection fog is

* cold air passing over a cold surface

* warm air passing over a warm surface

* cold air passing over a warm surface

* warm air passing over a cold surface

----

One of the prerequisites for the formation of a thunderstorm is

* the presence of moist air through a considerable depth of the atmosphere

* a rapid drop in surface temperature with an increase in wind strength

* a gradual increase in cloud cover above 20000ft

* a cold isothermal later through a considerable depth of the atmosphere

----

Advection fog forms when

* cold air passes over a cold surface

* cold air passes over a warm surface

* warm air passes over a warm surface

* warm air passes over a cold surface

----

Dust storms are most likely to produce which of the following hazards?

* severe visibility restriction in a localised area below 10000ft

* severe visibility restriction over a widepsread area below 10000ft

* severe visibility restriction over a widepsread area to heights above 10000ft

----

The most dangerous effect of a mature thunderstorm is

* turbulence

* lightning

* hail

* icing

----

Slant visibility in fog causes

* reduced visibility towards the sun

* the runway is visible from 'over the top' but not in the circuit area or on final

* better visibility looking up than down

* runway visual range is less than meteorological visibility

----

The runway at a coastal aerodrome runs parallel to the coast. When would the crosswind component be likely to be strongest?

* early in the morning

* late at night

* in the early afternoon

* at sunset
