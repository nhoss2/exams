# Bob Tait RPL Study Guide Chapter Revision Human Performance 4

The two difference types of light sensitive elements on the retina are classified as

* rods which are sensitive to colour and cones which work best in dim light

* cones which are sensitive to colour and rods which work best in dim light

* rods and cones both of which respond equally to all lighting conditions

* rods and cones both of which are responsible for colour vision

----

The blind spot is

* the area of the lens which is screened by the iris

* the black spot in the centre of the coloured section of the eye

* at the junction of the optic nerve and the retina

* an area on the cornea which does not respond to light

----

If a pilot whose eyes have fully adapter to darkness is exposed to a bright flash of light, the time required for dark adaptation to be re-established is most likely to be

* 3 minutes

* 5 minutes

* 15 minutes

* 30 minutes

----

The maximum distance at which a healthy eye in good lighting and contrast could identifiy a circle one metre in diameter is approximately

* one kilometre

* five kilometres

* 2 nautical miles

* five hundred metres

----

In level flight, a collision risk exists if a converging aircraft viewed from your cockpit appears to be

* on the horizon and maintaining a constant position in your windscreen

* below the horizon and moving closer to the centre of your windscreen

* on the horizon and moving away from the centre of your windscreen

* on the horizon

----

The most effective way to scan the sky for other aircraft during level flight is to

* move the head in continuous arc from side to side

* keep the head still and move the eyes continuously from side to side

* do not look anywhere but straight ahead unless you detect movement

* move the head about 20deg or 30deg at a time, pausing after each movement to allow the peripheral vision to detect any movement

----

Heavy rain may have the effect of making objects viewed through the windscreen appear,

* further away than they actually are

* closer than they actually are

* larger than they actually are

* brighter than they actually are
