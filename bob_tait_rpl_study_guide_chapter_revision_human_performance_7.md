# Bob Tait RPL Study Guide Chapter Revision Human Performance 7

The transfer of oxygen to the blood stream during respiration depends most directly upon

* the breathing rate

* the partial pressure of oxygen within the lungs

* the percentage of lung capacity achieved with each breath [depth of breathing]

* the volume of oxygen inhaled with each breath

----

If a pilot suspects that he/she is suffering the effects of hypoxia, the most appropriate remedy would be

* voluntarily increase the breathing rate to increase the oxygen uptake

* voluntarily increase the depth of breathing to induce more oxygen into the lungs

* voluntarily increase both the rate and depth of breathing

* use supplemental oxygen or descend immediately to a lower level

----

Which of the following is *not* normally a symptom of hypoxia?

* cyanosis

* a feeling of euphoria

* severe headache

* erratic behaviour

----

CAO 20.4.7 requries that supplemental oxygen be provided and used by the pilot at all times during flight above

* 20000 feet

* 10000 feet

* 14000 feet

* 8000 feet

----

One of the effects of hypoxia is a degradation of night vision. This effect begins at about

* 4000 feet

* 10000 feet

* 14000 feet

* 20000 feet

----

Oxygen is transported around the body by

* haemoglobin

* white blood cells

* plasma

* the nervous system

----

A heavy smoker will suffer the effects of hypoxia at a lower altitude than a non-smoker. While flying at an altitude of 5000 feet, a heavy smoker could be experiencing the same degree of hypoxia as a non-smoker at

* 5000 feet

* 10000 feet

* 15000 feet

* 20000 feet

----

Hypoxia may be caused by

* flying with a head cold

* flying at an altitude where the partial pressure of oxygen is too low

* breathing too quickly and/or too deeply for the requirements of the body

* flying after a period of underwater diving

----

Hypoxia is *always* accompanied by

* high temperature and vomiting

* dizziness

* profuse sweating

* a degradation in the performance of a pilot

----

Cyanosis can be identified by

* rapid breathing

* a blue coloration of the fingernail beds and lips

* slurred speech

* difficult in maintaining balance
