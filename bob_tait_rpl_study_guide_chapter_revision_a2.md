# Bob Tait RPL Study Guide Chapter Revision A2

The relative airflow is always

* opposite the direction of motion and faster than the true airspeed

* in the same direction as motion and equal to the true airspeed

* opposite the direction of motion and equal to the true airspeed

* in the same direction as motion and faster to the true airspeed

----

All of the aerodynamic forces acting on an aerofoil can be resolved into a single force acting on a single point. This single force is called

* lift

* drag

* the total reaction

* total lift

----

The force of lift is

* that component of the total reaction acting at right angles to the relative airflow

* that component of the total reaction acting parallel to the relative airflow

* the combined effect of all forces acting on an aerofoil

* that component of the total reaction acting at right angles to the chord line

----

The angle of attack of an aerofoil is the angle between

* the relative airflow and the bottom surface of the wing

* the nose of the aircraft and the horizon

* the chord line and the horizon

* the chord line and the direction of the relative airflow

----

The magnitude of the total aerodynamic reaction on an aerofoil depends upon

* the speed of the relative airflow only

* the angle of attack only

* both the angle of attack of the aerofoil and the speed of the relative airflow

* the forward speed of the aerofoil only

----

To maintain level flight at a lower airspeed

* the aircraft must fly at a higher nose attitude and an increased angle of attack

* the aircraft must fly at a lower nose attitude and an increased angle of attack

* the aircraft must fly at a higher nose attitude and an decreased angle of attack

* the aircraft must fly at a lower nose attitude and an decreased angle of attack

----

Once the stalling angle has been reached, any further increase in angle of attack will result in

* more lift and less drag

* more lift and more drag

* less lift and less drag

* less lift and more drag

----

Level flight is not possible at speeds below the stalling speed because

* the maximum lift available is less than weight

* there is no lift available

* drag becomes greater than lift

* the air flowing over the control surfaces produces no reaction

----

For any given airspeed, the stalling angle of attack at which

* drag reaches its maximum value

* lift reaches its minimum value

* drag reaches its minimum value

* lift reaches its maximum value

----

As the angle of attack is increased from zero to beyond the stalling angle at a constant airspeed, the magnitude of the force of lift

* increases continuously

* increases then decreases

* decreases continuously

* decreases then increases
