# Aviation Theory Centre Pre-Area Solo

An aircraft fitted with a piston engine must be fuelled with:

* AVTUR fuel.

* Unleaded fuel.

* Leaded Fuel.

* MOGAS.

* AVGAS.

----

What colour is AVGAS 100LL?

* Clear or straw colour.

* Blue.

* Red or purple.

* Green.

----

The carburettor heat can be used as:

* an anti-icing action (ice prevention).

* a de-icing action (ice removal).

* an alternate supply of air to the engine.

* all the above.

----

Should ice form in your carburettor and you have a small reduction in MP, rpm, or airspeed, you should:

* keep adjusting power by opening the throttle.

* adjust carburettor heat, full on.

* use alternate static.

----

Ice that forms on the engine air filter is known as:

* throttle ice.

* fuel evaporation ice.

* impact ice.

----

What common action should be taken if impact or throttle icing occurs?

* Reduce power.

* Increase power.

* Apply carburettor heat.

* Warm the engine.

----

After flying for sometime, the centre-zero ammeter shows almost zero (just a small positive indication). This would mean:

* that the aircraft alternator has failed and the battery is providing all the power.

* insufficient electrical output is being produced by the alternator.

* that the battery is being recharged.

* that the battery is fully charged and the system is working normally.

----

If the alternator fails, the electrical system will receive its power from

* an emergency generator.

* the battery.

* a wind driven electrical generating device.

----

Should the alternator fail and the battery power be consumed:

* the engine-driven fuel pump would stop working.

* the fuel boost pump would still be available.

* most of the engine instruments would stop working.

* the engine would malfunction.

----

Excessive priming of an engine for start can:

* cause the spark to occur at the incorrect time.

* increase the risk of a manifold fire during start.

* reduce the amount of fuel available in the manifold.

* adversely affect the oil pressure.

----

Aircraft fuel tanks require a vent, the purpose of which is to:

* avoid a build-up of dangerous fumes.

* allow condensation inside the tank to escape.

* allow the pressure inside the tank to equalise with the outside pressure.

----

Aircraft spark plugs may become fouled with a build-up of lead from the fuel, if the engine is operated for any length of time at a:

* high power setting with a lean mixture.

* low power setting with a lean mixture.

* high power setting with a rich mixture.

* low power setting with a rich mixture.

----

If you set the altimeter to QNH, the instrument should read:

* zero feet.

* density altitude.

* pressure altitude.

* vertical distance AMSL.

----

The red radial line on the airspeed indicator represents the:

* structural cruising speed.

* landing gear lowering speed.

* normal operating speed range.

* never exceed speed.

----

Rotation about the longitudinal axis is referred to as:

* yawing, and is effected by the rudder.

* yawing, and is effected by the ailerons.

* rolling, and is effected by the ailerons.

* pitching, and is effected by the elevator.

----

The tendency of an aircraft to return to its original condition when disturbed from straight and level flight is known as:

* controllability

* manoeuvreability.

* stability.

* balance.

----

During a climbing turn you must be careful of:

* the tendency to over-bank the aircraft as the horizon is not always obvious.

* decreasing your rate of climb.

* the tendency to under-bank the aircraft as the horizon is not always obvious.

----

How is the aircraft's performance affected by mud or minor damage on the surface of the wings?

* Lift is decreased, drag is decreased.

* Lift is increased, drag is decreased.

* Lift is increased, drag is increased.

* Lift is decreased, drag is increased.

----

A blockage of the static system would likely be corrected by applying:

* alternate air on.

* pitot heat on.

* alternate static on.

* carburettor heat on.

----

During your take-off roll, the airspeed indicator remains at zero. You should:

* abort the take-off.

* try to work out why the ASI is not working.

* estimate your rotate speed.

* select alternate static and pitot heat on.

----

If after landing, you find one brake is not working, you should:

* stop on the runway.

* taxi back to the parking tarmac as the nosewheel steering will still be functional.

* allow your aircraft to slow using most of the runway, taxi clear of the landing area and radio for assistance on the ground frequency.

----

For proper internal cooling the engine must have:

* a functioning oil cooler thermostat.

* a correctly leaned mixture setting.

* circulating oil at a pressure within the permissible range.

* proper airflow over the exhaust manifold.

----

If you encounter gusting wind in the circuit, what speed would you try to maintain on the final approach?

* About 5kt above the stall to minimise the impact of the gusts.

* Normal approach speed because it is chosen to account for such conditions.

* About 5 to 10kt above the normal approach speed depending upon the strength of the gusts.

* Manoeuvre speed.

----

After start, engine oil pressure must reach normal operating pressure (the green sector) within:

* 30 minutes.

* 10 minutes.

* 15 seconds.

* 30 seconds.

----

While taxiing, you notice another aircraft is approaching you on the same taxiway from the opposite direction. Should you:

* continue straight ahead and be prepared to stop.

* move to the left and stop if necessary.

* move to the right and stop if necessary.

* stop immediately.

----

An aircraft will stall:

* at a higher speed if power is increased.

* at the same indicated airspeed as altitude increases.

* when the aircraft's weight exceeds lift.

* at a lower indicated airspeed as altitude decreases.

----

When considering the hazards of wake turbulence, the wingtip vortices trailing behind large aeroplanes in flight:

* will present no hazard when the vortices are encountered in level cruising flight.

* will increase in intensity and violence as the speed of the large aeroplane increases.

* are most severe when the large aeroplane is at low speed during climbs or approaches for landings.

----

For proper cooling the engine must have:

* the correct mixture setting for that operation.

* the correct quantity of oil in the engine.

* the correct amount of cooling airflow around the engine.

* all of the above.

----

Detonation occurs in a reciprocating engine when:

* a spark plug is fouled and shorts out.

* the mixture is too rich.

* the charge explodes instead of just burning.

* hot spots ignite the mixture too soon.

----

Although the master switch is off, before leaving an aircraft a pilot mustalso ensure that the magneto switch is off. The reason for this is:

* the magneto system is independent of aircraft power and the engine could start if the propeller was turned.

* so the key can be removed.

* the magneto system will have no earth and cannot be energised.

* the battery will not discharge over night.
