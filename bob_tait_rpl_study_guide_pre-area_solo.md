# Bob Tait RPL Study Guide Pre-Area Solo

The point about which pitch, roll and yaw occur during flight is the

* centre of pressure

* wing roots

* the mid point between the nose and the tail

* the centre of gravity

----

The location of the centre of gravity of an aeroplane

* is a fixed point determined by the manufacturer

* depends upon the load distribution within the aircraft

* remains constant during any one flight

* moves forward if weight is added to the rear

----

The induced drag acting on aircraft in straight and level flight is

* greatest when speed is low and the aircraft is heavy

* greatest when speed is high and the aircraft is heavy

* greatest when speed is low and the aircraft is light

* greatest when speed is high and the aircraft is light

----

Which of the following would increase the parasite drag on an aircraft?

* decreasing the IAS

----

The least amount of total drag in level flight occurs

* at the high end of the speed range at about cruising speed

* when the aircraft is flying as slowly as possible

* at a speed about equal to the best gliding speed, with the flaps retracted

* at a speed about equal to the best gliding speed, with the flaps extended

----

The IAS which produces the best gliding performance in still air is

* the IAS which produces maximum lift

* the IAS which produces the best lift/drag ratio

* the IAS which requires least control deflection

* the IAS which results from a level nose attitude

----

----

Which of the following factors will increase the angle of climb of an aircraft?

* at the same IAS as is required for best angle, but with less than full power

* at an IAS higher than that required for best angle, but with less than full power

* at an IAS higher than that required for best angle with full power applied

----

What effect will turning have on climb performance?

* 100 KIAS

----

The elevator control is abruptly pulled to the fully aft position to induce a stall

* the stall will occur at a higher speed than normal

----

The best way to avoid the wake turbulence behind a heavy aircraft which has just landed is to

* aim to touch down at point before the touch-down point of the heavy aircraft

* aim to touch down at the same point as the heavy aircraft

* aim to touch down at a point ahead of the touch-down point of the heavy aircraft

* aim to touch down behind the heavy aircraft but on one side of the runway

----

Which of the following would result in a decrease in the rate of climb?

* a reduction in engine power output

* an increase in headwind component

* a decrease in headwind component

----

The purpose of a carburettor is

* to mix the correct amount of air with fuel to ensure efficient combustion

* to remove any dust particles from the air on its way to the engine

* to remove any water from the fuel before it can get to the engine

* to cool the air on its way to the engine to prevent detonation

----

Under what circumstances can carburettor ice form?

* only when the outside air temperature is below zero

* only if the aircraft is flying in rain or drizzle

* only at low power settings in cold moist air

* over a very wide range of temperatures, both inside and outside of cloud

----

Under which of the following circumstances would carburettor ice be difficult to detect?

* at full power during take-off

* during a long climb

* during a long descent at low power

* during cruise just below a cloud base

----

What is the correct method of using carburettor heat during a long power-off glide?

* carburettor heat should be applied only if carburettor ice is suspected

* carburettor heat should be applied before the throttle is closed and it should be left on during the glide

* carburettor heat should be applied just before power is re-applied at the end of the glide

* carburettor heat should be applied regularly for brief intervals during the glide

----

Carburettor icing during cruise will be indicated to the pilot by

* a drop in RPM, a reduction in cruise speed and rough running

* no change in RPM, but a reduction in cruise speed and a height loss

* the engine back firing when power is increased

* increasing RPM even though there has been no change in the throttle position

----

If an aircraft fitted with a carburettor and a gravity feed fuel system has a blockage in the fuel tank vent

* there will be less power available during take-off

* the engine will be very difficult to start

* the engine may fail during flight due to fuel starvation

* the engine may run roughly due to an excessively rich mixture

----

Detonation in an aircraft engine is most likely when

* both the engine and fuel are hot and high power is applied

* full power is applied during take-off with the mixture fully rich

* the throttle is opened after a long descent

* the aircraft is cruising at high power for a long period of time

----

If detonation is suspected during a long climb you should

* reduce the power and raise the nose to climb at a lower speed

* increase the power and raise the nose to climb at the same airspeed

* reduce the power and raise the nose to increase rate of climb

* reduce the power, check that the mixture is fully rich and lower the nose to climb at a higher airspeed

----

Which of the following instruments would be affected by a failure of the vacuum pump?

* the altimeter

* the vertical speed indicator

* the airspeed indicator

* the artificial horizon

----

If the altimeter fails to indicate any height change after take-off the most likely cause is

* the vacuum pump has failed

* the pitot tube is blocked

* the static vent is blocked

* the incorrect QNH was set before take-off

----

If your aircraft was accidentally refuelled with jet fuel [AVTUR] instead of the correct type of fuel

* you would notice a big increase in power during take-off

* you would experience a significant power loss accompanied by rough running, detonation and high engine temperatures

* there would be no particular effect as long as the tank contains less than half AVTUR

* there would be a slight reduction in power but you could continue with the proposed flight

----
