In sensing the orientation of the body in space, the brain assigns the highest priority to information coming from

* the eyes

* the inner ear

* the middle ear

* the proprioceptive system

----

Which of the following is the most likely cause of disorientation?

* a change in the information coming from the inner ear

* a conflict or ambiguity in the information coming from visual, vestibular and postural cues

* poor lighting reducing the amount of visual information received

* a rapid transition from level flight to a steep climb

----

In the absence of reliable visual information, which of the following states of motion would be most difficult to differentiate?

* a steep turn and a rapid deceleration in level flight

* a rapid acceleration in level flight and a transition from level flight to a dive

* a rapid acceleration in level flight and a transition from level flight to a climb

* a rapid deceleration in level flight and a transition from level flight to a climb

----

You are making an approach by day into a runway where the terrain slopes up from the threshold of intended landing. The most likely misjudgment during this approach would be

* an overestimate of your height above the runway threshold

* an underestimate of your height above the runway threshold

* an underestimate of your speed during the approach

* an overestimate of the length of the runway

----

Which of the following organs mediates the sense of balance?

* eustachian tube

* the eardrum

* the semicircular canals

* the cochlea

----

The susceptibility to disorientation is increased if the pilot is suffering from anxiety, stress or mental fatigue

* this statement is false

* this statement is true
